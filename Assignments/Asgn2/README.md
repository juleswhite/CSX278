# Assignment 2: JHipster 
## Introduction

JHipster is a free open-source application generator used to quickly develop modern web applications using AngularJS and the Spring Java Framework.

## Readings
+ [Intro to JHipster](https://spring.io/blog/2015/02/10/introducing-jhipster)
+ [JHipster Documentation](https://jhipster.github.io/)
-The whole website is useful, so make sure to explore the subpages (like their [video tutorial](https://jhipster.github.io/video-tutorial/), [creating an application](https://jhipster.github.io/creating-an-app/), and [creating an entity]( https://jhipster.github.io/creating-an-entity/) pages.

+ [Installing JHipster](http://www.uvionicstech.com/blog/development/jhipster-installation-and-build-guide/)
+ [UML](https://jhipster.github.io/jhipster-uml/)

### Acknowledgements
+ Most of our readings come directly from the JHipster documentation provided by the developers and creators of JHipster. Also, within the articles, are video guides created by the founder of JHipster, Julien Dubois. Aside from the video, most of the articles were written or updated in the last year, and though new versions have been released, the basics of JHipster have remained the same.

##Assignment 2 Spec: 

*Due Date: 9/27*

In this assignment, you will develop a simple student contact list consisting of a database of students using JHipster.

**Installing JHipster and other prerequisite software (to be done before class)**

1. Install Node.js from [the Node.js website](http://nodejs.org/) (prefer an LTS version). This will also install npm, which is the node package manager we are using in the next commands.
2. Install Yeoman: `npm install -g yo`
3. Install Bower: `npm install -g bower`
4. Install Gulp: `npm install -g gulp-cli` (If you have previously installed a version of gulp globally, please run `npm rm -g gulp` to make sure your old version doesn&#39;t collide with gulp-cli)
5. Install JHipster: `npm install -g generator-jhipster`


You may also choose to follow the guide linked [here](http://www.uvionicstech.com/blog/development/jhipster-installation-and-build-guide/).
Once completed, type `yo jhipster` into the command line, and email a picture of the output to a member of our team.

 **Setting up your JHipster application (to be completed in class)**

1. First of all, create an empty directory in which you will create your application: `mkdir myapplication`
2. Go to that directory: `cd myapplication/`
3. To generate your application, type: `yo jhipster`
4. Answer the questions asked by the generator to create an application tailored to your needs.
For this project, we will be using the following setup configuration:

(1/16) Which \*type\* of application would you like to create?
`Monolithic application (recommended for simple projects)`

(2/16) What is the base name of your application?
`<name>`

(3/16) What is your default Java package name?
`org.jhipster.com`

(4/16) Which \*type\* of authentication would you like to use?
`HTTP Session Authentication stateful, default Spring Security mechanism)`

(5/16) Do you want to use social login (Google, Facebook, Twitter)? Warning, this doesn&#39;t work with Cassandra!
`No`

(6/16) Which \*type\* of database would you like to use?
`SQL (H2, MySQL, MariaDB, PostgreSQL, Oracle)`

(7/16) Which \*production\* database would you like to use?
`MySQL`

(8/16) Which \*development\* database would you like to use?
`H2 with disk-based persistence`

(9/16) Do you want to use Hibernate 2nd level cache?
`Yes, with ehcache (local cache, for a single node)`

(10/16) Do you want to use a search engine in your application?
`No`

(11/16) Do you want to use clustered HTTP sessions?
`No`

(12/16) Do you want to use WebSockets?
`No`

(13/16) Would you like to use Maven or Gradle for building the backend?
`Gradle`

(14/16) Would you like to use the LibSass stylesheet preprocessor for your CSS
`No`

(15/16) Would you like to enable internationalization support?
`No`

(16/16) Which testing frameworks would you like to use?
`NONE (deselect the default)`

5. Ensure that all of your package managers loaded correctly: npm install &amp;&amp; bower install &amp;&amp; gulp install

**Objective (to be completed at home)**

Design a contact list application which stores the following information about a student in each entry:

- Email
- Full Name
- Preferred Contact Method
- Phone number
- Graduation Date
- Dormitory
- School

**Creating and Importing JDL file**

In order to create a contact list, you will need to create entities, which represent elements of the contact, and indicate the relationships between them using JDL studio, found at [_https://jhipster.github.io/jdl-studio/_](https://jhipster.github.io/jdl-studio/)_._


You should attempt to recreate the following entity heirarchy:

To import the JDL file in your project, run command: `yo jhipster:import-jdl <filename>` and then rebuild to incorporate changes.

**Building and running your JHipster application**

1. Windows users: run `gradlew` | Mac users: run `./gradlew`
2. Access your application at `http://localhost:8080`
